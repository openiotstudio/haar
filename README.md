# Haar

### There is a ‘being in the know’ about the traditions and superstitions of the sea, which inspired us to create a way for a new generation of coastal teens to use ‘code’ of nautical flags to access Internet in a cave.

When the haar rolls in lock all windows and doors or all children will disappear

A cup of tea stirred counter clockwise brings the haar

Hang a loved ones belonging from a pagan tree and they will return safely from their travels

It’s bad luck to post a selfie on a Thursday

If you crack your iphone screen you’ll have 7 years bad luck on tinder

If you screengrab a snapchat the sender will lose their fortune

Never join a what’s app group in bare feet
